# Thesis
A research approach to the parallel version of the Local Modified Successive Over-Relaxation (LMSOR) algorithm, enriched with the red-black reordering method.

Time measurements were calculated on GRNET's Aris Hypercomputer in Athens, Greece. See [more about Aris HPC](https://hpc.grnet.gr/) 
or Aris HPC's [official documentation](http://doc.aris.grnet.gr/).

The complete thesis can also be found [here](https://pergamos.lib.uoa.gr/uoa/dl/frontend/el/browse/2320638).

This repository contains the approach on this project by [me](https://github.com/Thanasis17m) and [Parism](https://github.com/Parism).
